## About

I am Sandra Tamakloe, a graduate student passionately exploring the synergy of Economics and Business. In my academic journey, I aim to leverage data to tell compelling stories, blending the analytical depth of economics with the strategic insights of business. As a Graduate Assistant at Memorial University, I contribute to academia while delving into the potential of data-driven narratives to shape our understanding of complex economic systems.
